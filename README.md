- Your landing page must have a form element with a corresponding `id="form"`.
- Within the form, there should be an input field with `id="email"` where users can enter an email address.
- The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to indicate its purpose.
- The `#email` input field should utilize HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is a valid email address.
- Within the form, there should be a submit input with a corresponding `id="submit"`.
- Clicking the `#submit` element should submit the email to a static page (use this mock URL: `https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit`).

- Your product landing page should include at least one media query.
- Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
